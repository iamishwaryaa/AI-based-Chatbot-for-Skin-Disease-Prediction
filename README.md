# AI-based-Chatbot-for-Skin-Disease-Prediction-using-Customised-CNN-Decision-Tree-and-NLP
Efficient and accurate system for diagnosing skin diseases that leverages the power of CNN, Dynamic ID3 decision tree, and NLP.

Skin disease prediction chatbot project aims to create a chatbot that can help
people predict the type of skin disease they may have based on their symptoms.
The chatbot will utilize a Customized Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
model to categorize images of the user's skin and build a Decision Tree model to
predict the most probable diagnosis based on the user's responses to a
questionnaire. The CNN model will be trained on a dataset of skin images to
classify them into different categories, such as squamous cell carcinoma, basal
cell carcinoma, melanoma, nevus, actinic keratosis, seborrheic keratosis. The
model will learn to identify patterns and features that are specific to each category
and use that knowledge to make predictions about new images. The chatbot will
use a decision tree to ask a series of questions about the user's symptoms, such as
the location of the rash, its color, and any associated symptoms. The chatbot will
then use this information to make a prediction based on the Decision Tree model
with an accuracy of 91.557%. The chatbot will interact with the user through
Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, to answer general questions
posed by the user. The project's goal is to create an easy-to-use, accessible, and
reliable tool for people who may not have access to or may not be able to afford
a dermatologist by utilizing advanced machine learning techniques, such as CNN
and Decision Trees, and integrating NLP in the chatbot.
